- Vendor/Driver dashboards query data where ID matches logged-in user.
- Firestore rules ensure isolation per user type.
- Admin has full access.

REALTIME NOTIFICATIONS
- Use Firestore listeners and FCM.
- Trigger toasts for new vendor/driver registration, order creation, payouts, approvals.

THEME
- Dual theme (Light/Dark)
- Save user preference locally or in Firestore.

SECURITY RULES (Simplified)
- Vendors access data where vendorId == auth.uid
- Drivers access data where driverId == auth.uid
- Admins access all data
